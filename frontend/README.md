# frontend

This is the SvelteKit frontend of the inventory application. It was created with typescript, shadcn-svelte and tailwindcss. The frontend provides a minimal user interface where the users can authenticate and interact with the items of their inventories. Each user has a private inventory which can store values about quantities of data, descriptions and dates.

The frontend communicates with the backend component via HTTP requests and updated the interface depending on the API's responses.
